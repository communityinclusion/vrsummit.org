Support, present at, and attend the 6th Annual Summit on Vocational Rehabilitation Program Evaluation & Quality Assurance. Become part of a community of VR professionals committed to sharing promising practices in program evaluation that will further the effectiveness of the VR system and assure quality services for individuals with disabilities. Each year the practices disseminated during the Summit help strengthen VR systems across the country. Now we ask for your help to continue these efforts! The planning team seeks sponsors and exhibitors for this summit. Sponsorships can include networking events, keynote speakers, and exhibit tables.
