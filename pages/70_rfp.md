#Request for Papers
##Deadline: Midnight Eastern US Time Friday, April 26, 2013

The Planning Team for the 6th Annual Summit on VR Program Evaluation & Quality Assurance invites you to submit a proposal to present at this year’s Summit. The 6th annual summit will be held Monday and Tuesday, September 16 and 17, at the Omni Providence Hotel, in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. 

The goal of the Summit is threefold:  

* to provide educational experiences based on the expertise of knowledgeable professionals
* to encourage collaboration and information sharing and 
* to inspire movement towards excellence in program performance as a means of providing quality employment-related services to people with disabilities

All proposals must be submitted to www.VRSummit.org in advance of the deadline to be considered. Incomplete submissions, including those missing contact information, will not be forwarded for peer-review. We encourage a diverse group of presenters and researchers to submit papers for presentations and poster sessions, including practitioners, graduate students, and advocates, as well as those professionally involved in program evaluation in academia or administrative positions. We encourage proposals with innovative practices and up-to-date research from across the field with the intent of bringing the best of the best to this national stage!

To view presentations from Summit 5, visit the National Clearinghouse on Rehabilitation Training Materials (see “The Summit Group” under “Communities of Practice”): <https://ncrtm.org/moodle/mod/page/view.php?id=3377>.  

Best Wishes,  
<em>The 6th Annual Summit Planning Team</em>
