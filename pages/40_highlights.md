**Creativity, Measurement & Messaging:
Moving Towards Stronger Practices**  

[download the presentation](/assets/KEYNOTE_Creativity_Measurement_and_Knowledge.pptx)

Although promoting employment of people
with disabilities remains a major priority among
policymakers and practitioners, there is a dearth
of evidence on what works in this area. Summit
keynote speaker David Wittenburg will address
barriers and facilitators to developing evidence on
the efficacy of employment interventions and will
provide an overview of some of the key ingredients
needed to develop effective interventions that can
be convincing to skeptics. Focusing on three general
concepts of creativity, measurement, and messaging,
Wittenburg will discuss how these key ingredients
used in harmony can convince skeptical audiences
and help to spread promising practices. Wittenburg
will explore these concepts in action through recent
demonstrations, such as the Youth Transition
Demonstration. Attendees will learn how to test new
ideas and scale up existing ideas for better practices
and, ultimately, policies.  

David Wittenburg is a senior researcher in the Center for Studying Disability Policy and an associate director in the health division at Mathematica Policy Research. He has directed projects that examine interventions to promote employment among people with disabilities. He has published reports, journal articles, and policy briefs for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Department of Education on employment initiatives for people with disabilities and has a specific interest in interventions for transition-age youth. Wittenburg has also written extensively and testified before Congress on the challenges facing youth who receive Supplemental Security Income in transitioning to independence. He joined Mathematica in August 2005. He holds a Ph.D.
in economics from Syracuse University.

In a vocational
rehabilitation world
driven by numeric
results, excellence in
service provision is
often lost. Keynote
Steve Dickinson will
address what, why
and how excellence is
achieved in the real
world. He will explore
how management can
propel excellence by refining formal practices, linking
measurements to customer needs, and "just do it"
actions.  

Tools and processes will then be paired with how
to on-board already overwhelmed staff and other
complications that arise from a less predictable
human element. Kotter’s Model for creating change,
the Baldridge Model for enterprise excellent as well
as lessons learned during Dickinson’s thirty-three years of experience will guide a riveting discussion on
harnessing the power of people, tools and processes.
