###Summit Poster List

**California VR Service Delivery Teams | Presented by Pat Santillanes**  
The DOR 2013-2018 Strategic Plan Goal #1 Goal is to increase our current base of 11,000 successfully rehabilitated consumers to 15,000 by 2018. This presentation will focus on California’s shift to a new Vocational Rehabilitation Service Delivery (VRSD) Team Model that provides a more consumer-centric team approach. VRSD Teams will work collaboratively to implement VR service delivery processes to ensure program cost effectiveness, improved customer service and an increased number of quality consumer outcomes.  

**Electronic Case Reviews and Consumer Surveys | Presented by Janet Cool**  
Ohio VR developed a quality assurance software application that has been identified as part of an emerging practice by RSA. The application, known as VRQA, interfaces with the AWARE case management system and is utilized by Program Integrity and Evaluation staff to identify statewide patterns and trends in both the quality and compliance of case documentation. VRQA data is reported to stakeholders through VIS/Tableau reports and dashboard reports summarizing case review and consumer survey results.

**Methodologies to Conduct a Needs Assessment | Presented by Janet Cool**  
This poster will provide an overview of Ohio’s 2012 Vocational Rehabilitation Comprehensive Statewide Needs Assessment (CSNA) which was a joint effort between Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission (RSC) and The Ohio State University. Methodology to identify prevalence rates, projections of individuals with disabilities, penetration rates, and the concept of relative proportionality will be covered as well as the ongoing operational use of the CSNA findings.
 
**SuRGE: An Engine for Emergent Knowledge in VR Performance | Presented by Andrew Clemons**  
This poster will introduce attendees of the 6th Summit Conference to the Summit Reading Groups for Excellence (SuRGE). Through an interactive display, individuals will explore the history, development, and future-scape of this professional learning community. SuRGE strives, in part, to (1) offer information on the processes of vocational rehabilitation (VR) evaluation, quality improvement, and performance management; and (2) create conversations about innovative ways to face concerns or challenges for the improvement of state VR agencies.
