Welcome to the 6th Annual Summit on Vocational Rehabilitation Program Evaluation & Quality Assurance. This year’s summit will continue the tradition of excellence and collaboration established over the past five years, as well as deliver new ideas from across the vocational rehabilitation field by offering opportunities to:

* Learn about promising practices from recognized experts in program evaluation and quality assurance
* Share your experiences, strategies, and tools with like-minded professionals
* Find support to continue improving employment service and outcomes for individuals with disabilities.

This year, VR organizations from greater New England, including The Institute for Community Inclusion and the VR-RTAC, are excited to host you at the Omni Providence Hotel in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, for a time of partnership, innovation, and learning. Providence provides a perfect stage for strengthening personal and professional relationships while furthering local, state, and national distinction in program evaluation and quality assurance.  

Throughout the spring and summer of 2013, check back for more information on summit highlights and schedule, as well as other useful information. We look forward to seeing you this fall!
